# webstatic

This is an example of embedding static web assest in a binary file for creation of a self contained website to be served locally with no required external asset store.  Primarily this seems useful for small tools that don't require an internet connection and will remain consistent when run locally since its display and fuction can't be affected by outside CSS, images, javascript, etc without need for a separate assets web service or CDN
